# Pokedex App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and consume data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

\***\*NB\*\***: I purposely tried to copy the UI design from [HealthDex](https://selleo.github.io/healthdex/) that I found on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6580701-HealthDex-A-Pok-mon-Pok-dex-web-application) while looking for inspiration. But I can guarantee that the implementation of the code is on my own, using the sources that I have listed below.
